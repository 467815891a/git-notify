git-notify
========

Watches origin/master for new commits and notifies you.

    ~/code/some-git-repository $ git-notify &

The & on the end will make it run in the background instead of eating your terminal.
It will check every minute for new commits since it started running. If more than one commit occurred in between checks, it will only notify you of the most recent commit.

Installation:
------------
Just download git-notify and put it somewhere in your path.
